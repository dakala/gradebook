"Mean of grades","<p>Add up all normalized grades and divide by the total number of grades.</p><p>e.g. A1 70/100, A2 20/80, A3 10/10, category max 100:<br>(0.7 + 0.25 + 1.0)/3 = 0.65 --> 65/100 Add up the normalized scores for each grade item, multiplied total scores by the weight of grade items, and divide the result by the sum of the weights.</p><p>e.g. A1 70/100 weight 10, A2 20/80 weight 5, A3 10/10 weight 3, category max 100:<br>(0.7*10 + 0.25*5 + 1.0*3)/18 = 0.625 --> 62.5/100</p>",basic_html,0,grade_aggregation_type,,mean_grades

"Simple weighted mean","<p>The weight used in the calculation is the maximum grade. The normalized grade is multiplied by the maximum grade for the activity. The boosted grades are added up, then divided by the total of all maximum grades.</p><p>e.g.A1 70/100, A2 20/80, A3 10/10, category max 100:<br> (0.7*100 + 0.25*80 + 1.0*10)/190 = 0.526 --> 52.6/100</p><p>A grade item can offer Extra credit for the category. In that case, the maximum grade is excluded from the grand total of maximum grades which is used to divide the total normalized grades.</p><p>e.g. A1 70/100, A2 20/80, A3 (extra credit) 10/10, category max 100:<br>(0.7*100 + 0.25*80 + 1.0*10)/180 = 0.556 --> 55.6/100</p>",basic_html,0,grade_aggregation_type,,mean_weighted_simple
"Median of grades", "<p>All normalized scores are arranged from lowest to highest. The middle grade is taken or the mean of the two middle ones if scores are even.</p><p>e.g. A1 70/100, A2 20/80, A3 10/10, category max 100:<br>0.7 + 0.25 + 1.0 --> 0.70 --> 70/100</p>",basic_html,0,grade_aggregation_type,,median_grades
"Smallest grade","<p>The lowest normalized grade is taken as representative of the category.</p><p>e.g. A1 70/100, A2 20/80, A3 10/10, category max 100:<br>min(0.7 + 0.25 + 1.0) = 0.25 --> 25/100</p>",basic_html,0,grade_aggregation_type,,grade_smallest
